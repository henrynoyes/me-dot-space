# Description

This desktop photo frame cycles through a collection of digial photos. The images are pulled from a Google Drive folder and displayed in a randomized order. The 3D-printed backing houses a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, which connects directly to the [Waveshare 10.1inch LCD display](https://www.waveshare.com/10.1inch-hdmi-lcd.htm). The white oak frame was crafted by [my brother](https://elliotnoyes.com/photo-frame).

*\* It used to integrate more seamlessly with Google Photos, but Google has since [removed the relevant API scope](https://developers.google.com/photos/support/updates).*
