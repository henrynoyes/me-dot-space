Inspired by a recent trip to the theater, my dad had the idea to build a backlit movie poster display for the basement. For the standard double-sided 27x40in poster size, we were confident we could put together a more premium-quality build than the [online stores](https://glowbox.shop/products) at the market price of $300. I took care of the electronics, and [my brother](https://elliotnoyes.com/light-box) whipped up a maple frame with a custom cove moulding. Below are some photos along with a rough bill of materials. The official E.T. poster is from [movieposters.com](https://movieposters.com).
