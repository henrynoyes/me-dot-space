# Description

I created a Stanley Cupâ€“themed button that wirelessly connects to a speaker via Bluetooth and plays a goal horn when activated. The 3D-printed structure houses a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and a simple momentary push button. On top is an interchangeable NHL puck that can be pressed down to trigger the goal horn.
