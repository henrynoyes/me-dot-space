# Overview

SpriteSaver is a screensaver for displaying animated sprites. It is designed to be minimal, inspired by the familiar [bouncing DVD logo](https://www.bouncingdvdlogo.com/). It is configured as a module in [XScreenSaver](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/) with settings to adjust the movement speed and animation delay.

In short, I had an idea for a simple screensaver to display some of my favorite Pok√©mon sprites. After searching for a solution online, I came up empty, so I built this.
